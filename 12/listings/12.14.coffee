#A lib/modules.coffee contains the code from listing 12.13
#B CoffeeScript is compiled bare. Meaning that there is no outer function wrapper
#C As this is in the build where you donâ€™t care about blocking - readFileSync is acceptable.
#D The actual file output is the compiled CoffeeScript wrapped in the defmodule call.
#E All of the modules are concatenated with a simple join
#F Write the entire compiled application to application.js
